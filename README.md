##Description

This arduino sketch controls a lamp with
* an Adafruit Flora V2 (https://www.adafruit.com/products/659),
* an Adafruit NeoPixel ring (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1463) and
* an Adafruit acceleration/magnetic/gyroscope sensor (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2020).

Shake the lamp according to the z-axis to switch between different programs.
Turn the lamp about 90 degree and rotate it to increase or decrease the LED brightness.
Turn the lamp about 180 degree and it will jump into deep standby.

Implemented programs:

1. Rainbow colors
2. Theatre-style crawling lights with rainbow effect
3. Color changes dependen on the temperature
4. Color can be changed by rotating around the z-axis
5. Color moves like knight rider

Have fun!
